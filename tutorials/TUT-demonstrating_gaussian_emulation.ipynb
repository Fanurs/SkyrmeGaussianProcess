    "# Emulating an actual simulation data from ImQMD\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will be emulating the simulation data from Improved Quantum Molecular Dynamics (ImQMD) that can be found under the directory `$PROJECTDIR/database/SnSn_e35b6x-1`, where `$PROJECTDIR` is the path of this project repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under `$PROJECTDIR/database/SnSn_e35b6x-1`, the directory structure and naming convention match the default output by ImQMD, which is a fortran executable simulation program. The actual ImQMD software is not included in this repository as it is not part of the intellectual properties of this project. Also, the raw outputs from ImQMD software are not included as their file sizes are huge (many GB for each). Instead, the analyzed results have been extracted using some `C++` program (mainly for speed) and saved as `NP-EK-A16Z6.DAT`, which can be found under every sub-directory in `$PROJECTDIR/database/SnSn_e35b6x-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since ImQMD simulations can take a long time to run even on HPCC (High Performance Computing Center), our goal is to emulate the analyzed results from simulation inputs (the Skyrme parameters).\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is the summary:\n",
    "- Inputs of simulation: `$PROJECTDIR/database/SnSn_e35b6x-1/param.dat`. Each row represents one simulation run.\n",
    "- Raw outputs of simulation: Not included in this repository.\n",
    "- Analyzed outputs of simulation: `$PROJECTDIR/database/SnSn_e35b6x-1/$subdir/NP-EK-A16Z6.DAT`. Each sub-directory `$subdir` represents one simulation run. They follow the directory structure of the actual ImQMD software."
