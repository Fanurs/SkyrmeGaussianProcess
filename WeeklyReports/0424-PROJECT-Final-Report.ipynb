    "\n",
    "This program uses Gaussian process to emulate the simulation results from Improved Quantum Molecular Dynamics (ImQMD). Specifically, the program learns from a given sets of training data that contains the mapping from 4 Skyrme parameters into a vector of physical observables of interest. Gaussian process is then applied to emulate this mapping, serving as an interpolation to determine the physical observables for some new set of Skyrme parameters that are not included in the training data. Since emulation can be done much faster than the actual ImQMD simulation without losing much accuracy and precision, the invites many post-analysis such as Bayesian inference to infer the most probable Skyrme parameters given a certain experimental data."

    "# Statement of Need\n",
    "\n",
    "While nuclear collision simulations are important for understanding the nuances of Skyrme parameters have on the physical observables, they are usually computationally expensive to do. Hence, a reliable way to emulate the simulation within some range of interest to reproduce certain physical observables is desired."
